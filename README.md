# CS5012-Language-and-Computation

Two assignments relating to natural language processing.

## A1 - Part of speech tagging and unknown words

The objective of this assignment was to produce a natural language processing model to determine parts of speech tags, based on a given corpus using the Viterbi algorithm. Three corpora were provided to implement and evaluate: English, French and Ukrainian. Additionally, the model aimed to make informed predictions on unknown words based on UNK tags. The UNK tags are based on common patterns seen within the language Corpus.

## A2 - Grammar engineering

The objective of this assignment was to design a grammar to parse a limited subset of English consisting of eight valid sentences and three invalid sentences. Initially, context-free grammar was developed to define rules for parsing sentences. Then, the grammar was refined to become unification grammar which incorporates more rigorous rules to prevent parsing of invalid sentences.
