# CS5012-Language-and-Computation

Here are two recent assignments I completed for the University of St Andrews relating to Natural Language Processing.

## A1 - Speech Tagging and Unknown Words

The objective of this project was to produce a natural language processing model to determine parts of speech tags, based on a given corpus using the Viterbi algorithm. Three corpora were provided to implement and evaluate: English, French and Ukrainian. The model also aimed to make informed predictions on unknown words based on UNK tags. The UNK tags relate to common patterns seen within the language corpus.

## A2 - Grammar Engineering

The objective of this project was to design a grammatical model that parses a limited subset of English, consisting of eight valid sentences and three invalid sentences. Initially, context-free grammar was developed to define rules for parsing sentences. Then, the grammar was refined to become unification grammar which incorporates more rigorous rules to prevent parsing of invalid sentences.
